## Looking for The Original ReadyTin?

It's with deep regret that we inform you of the discontinuation of the ReadyTin product line.

We started in 2012 with big dreams of placing preparation in the pocket of every hiker, traveler, parent, student, and more. Despite our best intentions, we fell short of our ambitious goals and decided to close our doors in 2018. We apologize for not being able to continue to serve those who have grown to love our products through the years. We hope you can take with you the mission of "Always Ready" and continue to share the spirit everyday preparedness with others as a legacy to our products.

Sincerely,
The ReadyTin Team
